## General Information
Assignment Part-I
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Assignment Part-II
Some subjective questions needs to be submitted in pdf file 



 

## Conclusions
- Perofrmed Data cleaning
- EDA[ Univariate, Bivariate Etc]
- Data Preapartion [ Change into binary variable, dropping categoricall variables , derived metrics etc]
- Performed Linear Rgeression
-  Feature set was too high so perfromred RFE/VIF to further improve
-  Performed Ridge
-  Perfromed Lasso




## Technologies Used
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
